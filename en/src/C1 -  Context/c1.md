***Beagle Context***

Beagle is an open source framework that helps developers deploy Server-Driven applications in a cross-platform way:

* Developers can easily create and prototype frontend screens using Beagle's Backend library and its utilities for layout (positioning and appearance) and also control their behavior (actions).
* Once created, these screens can be requested by mobile or web frontend applications that use the Beagle Frontend library to render the layouts.

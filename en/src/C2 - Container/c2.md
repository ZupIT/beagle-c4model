**Level 2: System container diagram**


At this level, we showed in a more detailed way the system describing its containers (do not confuse with Docker) and how they communicate/interact. The emphasis here is on the architecture and the used technologies. The idea is to show the system in a macro way. A container can be a web application, a database, a file system, etc.


**Beagle's containers**

At the second detailed level, there are `backend` and `frontend` **containers**:

* Beagle Frontend is installed in Web and Mobile applications, which natively render the screens received from the Beagle backend.
* Beagle Backend is configured in the application's backend to facilitate the creation of the server-driven components.

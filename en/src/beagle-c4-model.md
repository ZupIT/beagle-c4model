# **Overview**

The software architecture defines the parts of the software and it is also the technology strategy of a project/product. It is very important for the users to see constant updates because, without them, failures may happen.

### **Software documentation**

Documenting a project's architecture takes time, knowledge of tools, and layout techniques. The biggest challenge is to avoid two scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Complex documentation can be confusing and obsolete and it loses the main purpose and it is a waste of time to produce something it won't be used.

* **Scenario 2:** Documents with flaws and not enough information.

In both cases, the final result can confuse the user.

The project's architecture is crucial for the user to have a better experience, so it is important to document because it answers questions like:

* How does my system integrate between itself and other systems?
* How can I escalate my application?
* How can I assure my application's security?

After all this, Beagle's team created a view of our architecture in a simpler way, the C4 Model.


## **What is C4Model?**

The C4 model was created by Simon Brown, it is based on 4+1 and UML. The model helps to solve architecture problems in the documentation, it is divided into 4 diagrams, each one has a different detail level to a specific audience. The idea is to bring a clearer view of the project deep diving at every level.


## **What is Beagle?**

Beagle is an open source framework for cross-platform development using the concept of Server-Driven UI.

When you use Beagle, you are able to: 

 - Quickly change the layout, data, navigation flow, or even logic, just by changing code in the backend.
 
 - Be more independent from mobile stores such as the App Store and Play Store because most changes will not need an in-app update.

 - Be more confident that the application will behave similarly on different platforms as code will be shared between backend and frontend.

 - Easily test new business hypotheses or make real-time fixes to applications to improve user experience and receive feedback.

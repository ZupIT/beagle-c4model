# Beagle C4model

# Introduction

This project was created using [c4builder](https://adrianvlupu.github.io/C4-Builder/)


Take a look at: 

- [PlantUml](http://plantuml.com/) creates diagrams from plain text.

- [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) creates rich text documents from plant text.

- [C4Model](https://c4model.com/) the idea behind maps of your code

- [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/RicardoNiepel/C4-PlantUML) C4 syntax support for generating plantuml diagrams

- [vscode-plantuml](https://github.com/qjebbs/vscode-plantuml) plugin for visual studio code to view diagrams at design time

# What is Beagle?

Beagle is an open source framework that helps developers implement Server-Driven UI in a cross-platform way.

By using Beagle, developers can:

 - Rapidly change an application layout, data, navigation flow, or even logic, just by changing code in the backend.
 - Be more independent of mobile stores, like App Store and Play Store, because most changes wonâ€™t need an app update.
 - Have more confidence that applications will behave similarly on different platforms, since code will be shared and standardized between backend and frontend.
 - Easily test new business hypothesis or make live fixes on applications to improve users' experience and receive feedback.

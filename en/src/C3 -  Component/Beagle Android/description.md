Beagle Android sets the relationship between Beagle Framework and Android applications. 

It orchestrates the creation of the views in the Android environment from components received from the Backend.

Beagle's components are: 

* Default and custom visual components (buttons, texts, text fields, etc).
* Default and custom actions (Navigation, Alert, SendRequest, etc).
* Default and custom operations (Arithmetic Operators, Logical Operators, etc.).

The diagram below shows the 'way' a component goes through inside an Android application that uses Beagle.
Beagle has an **annotation process** mechanism, it initially creates the framework configuration file called BeagleSetup.

This file is automatically generated when the project is assembled (build) for the first time, and the components created on Android are registered in it, such as actions, operations, visual components (buttons, texts, etc.), network layer, and others.

These components are annotated, so that the processor is able to map them, for example:

-  `@RegisterAction` is used to register actions.
-  `@RegisterOperation` is used to register operations.
-  `@RegisterWidget` is used to registed visual components.

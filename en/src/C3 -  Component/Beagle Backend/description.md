The Beagle Backend is a helper library that fastens the development of Beagle screens from a server application.
 - The Backend Starter automatically configures the library in Spring or Micronaut apllications.
 - The Framework offers the whole set of definitions that will be used in components creation.
 - The Framework also has a serializer handler that parses all the developed screen into the JSON that will be sent to the frontend.

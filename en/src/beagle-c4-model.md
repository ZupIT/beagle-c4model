**Overview**

By definition, software architecture is the technological strategy of a product and/or service, defining the parts that make up a system. And, like every strategy, it is critical that it is constantly updated, after all, non-viewing planning will tend to be flawed.

Documenting the architecture of a project will often be a dull process and that requires time, knowledge of tools, and techniques for diagramming and documentation. The biggest challenge within architecture documentation is to avoid two scenarios:

1. Very complex architecture documentation and that, therefore, tend to stalk and obsolete, losing its purpose. In other words: it spends plenty of time on documentation that tends to be unusable eventually.

2. Poor documentation with few or wrong information.

In both cases, the end result is that they end up disturbing more than helping.

The visualization of architecture is crucial in several aspects and responds to several questions, for example: "How does my system integrate with other systems? How can I scale my application? How to ensure security between my applications?", Among other points.

This was our motivation to develop the C4 Model, that is, that of visualization of our architecture in a very simple and effective way.


**What is C4Model?**

The C4 model is based on 4 + 1 and UML and was created by Simon Brown between 2006 and 2011. The model emerged with the intention of helping to solve the problem of documentation of flaws or difficulties to understand and maintain, bringing a clearer view of the architecture documented by covering several levels and that is relevant to the various "personas" involved.

It is divided into four types of diagrams, where each has a different level of detail and target audience. The idea is that each level is further deepened in the details and information of the previous level.


**What is Beagle?**
Beagle is an open-source framework for cross-platform development using the concept of Server-Driven UI.

When you use Beagle, you are able to: 

 - Quickly change the layout, data, navigation flow, or even logic, just by changing code in the backend.
 - Be more independent from mobile stores such as the App Store and Play Store because most changes will not need an in-app update.
 - Be more confident that the application will behave similarly on different platforms as code will be shared between backend and frontend.
 - Easily test new business hypotheses or make real-time fixes to applications to improve user experience and receive feedback.

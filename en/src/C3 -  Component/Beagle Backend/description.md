Beagle Backend is a support library that helps create Beagle screens from a server. 

Some of these resources are: 

- The Backend Starter automatically configures the library in applications using Spring or Micronaut. 

- The Framework provides all contracts that will be used in the creation of the components. It also has a serialization utility that transforms every screen created in JSON, and it will be sent to a frontend.
